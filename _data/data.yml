  title: Personal Details
  summary: |
    My name is Mattia Rebellato, I was born in Camposampiero in the province of Padua
    and now live in Galliera Veneta. I'm a young programmer looking to enter the software development world. 
    I really enjoy programming using different languages, my favorites being C and C++. I also enjoy playing soccer, skiing, 
    and fishing with my friends. My future dream is to have my own software development business, 
    and not just because I have other experience in various fields thanks to my work experience.
