    My name is Mattia Rebellato, I was born in Camposampiero in the province of Padua

    title: Work Experience
    details: |
Over the years, I've had various work experiences, partly because I'm a person who enjoys working, 
so I started working when I reached legal age. I'm skilled in using various industrial machinery because 
I worked on the assembly line at Lago Assemblaggi, located in Galliera Veneta, and I did mostly manual labor. 
I also worked as an electrician at Cecchin Impianti Srl, also in Galliera Veneta, where I learned to assemble 
electrical panels from scratch, creating the base and inserting all the necessary electrical components. Finally, 
I worked as a software developer at Control Applications in Belvedere, learning to use SAIA PLCs and the SAIA development 
environment and improving my knowledge of programming languages.
